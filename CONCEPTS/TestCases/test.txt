The line `const regex = /\d+/g;` defines a regular expression in JavaScript.
 Let me break it down for you:

1. `/`: The forward slashes `/` are used to enclose the regular expression pattern.
 In JavaScript, regular expressions are typically written between two forward slashes.

2. `\d`: This is a special character in regular expressions that matches any digit (0-9).

3. `+`: The `+` quantifier is used to match one or more occurrences of the
 preceding character or group. In this case, it means one or more digits.

4. `g`: This is a flag that stands for "global." It indicates that the regular
 expression should be applied globally to the input string, not just stopping at
  the first match. It allows the regular expression to find all matches in the input string.

So, the regular expression `/d+/g` is used to find one or more consecutive digits in a text.
 When applied to a string, it will find all occurrences of numbers in the string.

For example, if you have the string "I have 2 cats and 3 dogs," applying this regular
 expression would match and extract the numbers "2" and "3" from the string.
