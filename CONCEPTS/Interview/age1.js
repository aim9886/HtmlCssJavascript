// If your age is greater than 18, show me the output as welcome and
// if your age is lesser than 18, show me the output as exit

// Replace 'yourAge' with your actual age
const yourAge = 20; // Change this to your age

if (yourAge >= 18) {
  console.log("Welcome");
} else {
  console.log("Exit");
}

// O/P: Welcome (yourAge = 20)

// O/P: Exit (yourAge = 15)

// In this program, we use the if statement to check if the value of yourAge
//  is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, it will display "Welcome," and
//   if it's less than 18, it will display "Exit." Make sure to replace yourAge
//    with your actual age or the age you want to check.
