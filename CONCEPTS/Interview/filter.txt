The `filter()` method is a built-in JavaScript array method
that is used to create a new array containing elements from the original array
 that satisfy a specified condition. It does not modify the original array
  but returns a new array with the filtered elements.

The syntax for the `filter()` method is as follows:

const newArray = array.filter(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg]);


- `callback`: A function that is called for each element in the array. It takes up to three arguments:
  - `element`: The current element being processed.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array on which `filter` was called.

- `thisArg` (optional): An object to which the `this` keyword can refer within the `callback` function.

The `callback` function should return `true` to include the element in the new array or `false`
 to exclude it.

Here's a simple example using the `filter()` method to filter even numbers from an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]


In this example, the `filter()` method creates a new array `evenNumbers`
 containing only the even numbers from the `numbers` array, as specified
  by the condition in the callback function.
