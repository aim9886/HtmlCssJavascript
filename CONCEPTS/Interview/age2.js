// If your age is greater than 18, show me the output as welcome,
// if your age is lesser than 18, show me the output as exit and
// if your age is equal to 18, show me the output as stay

// You can achieve this using the if-else-if-else statement in
// JavaScript to handle all three conditions. Here's the code:

// Replace 'yourAge' with your actual age
const yourAge = 28; // Change this to your age

if (yourAge > 18) {
  console.log("Welcome");
} else if (yourAge < 18) {
  console.log("Exit");
} else {
  console.log("Stay");
}

// O/P: Welcome (yourAge = 20)

// O/P: Exit (yourAge = 15)

// O/P: Stay (yourAge = 18)

// In this program:

// If yourAge is greater than 18, it will display "Welcome."
// If yourAge is less than 18, it will display "Exit."
// If yourAge is exactly 18, it will display "Stay."

// Make sure to replace yourAge with your actual age or the age you want to check.
